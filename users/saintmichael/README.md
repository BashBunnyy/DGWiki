Welcome. I am the creator of **DGWiki** and the owner of **DG4E.net**, a hub for digital knowledge, experiments, and exploration.  

Currently, I’m focused on the next evolution of the Digital Gangster forum, codenamed `2um` aka `Digital Gangster 2.0`, a project blessed and inspired by YTCracker himself; A convergence of creativity, security, and chaos carefully channeled.  

I have been exploring, hacking, and shaping the internet since the early 2000s. This is back when the web was slower, stranger, and stitched together with curiosity, duct tape, and audacity. My early adventures straddled the greyhat line, testing limits and discovering vulnerabilities wherever they hid. Over time, I chose a path of ethical hacking, turning those lessons into tools for protection, education, and innovation.  

As an **Information Security Engineer** for `redacted`, I design, test, and defend complex systems, bringing the same curiosity and discipline that shaped my early hacking days into a professional and structured framework.

## What I Do

**Infosec Engineer**  
Ethical hacker. Digital Archangel. Guardian of the weak in cyberspace.  

I defend systems, networks, and data against exploitation, using curiosity, methodical thinking, and hard-earned experience as my weapons. Security, to me, is a balance of art and science;requiring patience, discipline, and ethical resolve.  

No shortcuts. No magic. No snake oil. Only careful observation, relentless testing, and an unwavering commitment to integrity.
