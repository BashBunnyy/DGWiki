This is the user template that you can use to build your wiki page. 

Copy this folder `YOURUSERHANDLE` directly into the `users` directory.

README.md is absolutely required for EVERY FUCKING DIRECTORY. If you want to have a custom nav bar on the side, check the `_sidebar.md`

You are required to keep the links as well as `Home` and `Users`

Your merge request will absolutely be denied if you change this.

The `YOURUSERHANDLE` directory is formatted and a direct copy of `saintmichael`

When attempting to add images to your wiki, please ensure your `img` directory is in the root of your handle directory and you must use hardcoded paths

ie
`![codeexecution](https://dgwiki.dg4e.net/users/saintmichael/tryhackme/img/picklerick3.png)`

Please keep things organized. dont make shit a mess.
